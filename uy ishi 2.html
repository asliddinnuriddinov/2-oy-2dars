<b>Disadvantages <a href="">[edit]</a></b>
<p>Compared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:</p>
<b>Performance <a href="">[edit]</a></b>
<p>The majority of laptops released in 2022 are capable of common tasks such as web browsing, video playback, and office applications, even at the low end. That said, performance of desktops often surpass comparably priced laptops. The upper limits of performance of laptops remain lower than desktops, due to mostly practical reasons, such as dcreased battery life, increased size and heat, etc.</p>
<strong>Upgradeabality <a href="">[edit]</a></strong>
<p>The upgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to thoroughly standardized desktops, due to technical and economic reasons. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Due to the integrated nature of laptops, however, the motherboard, CPU, and graphics, are seldom officially upgradeable. Some efforts towards industry standard parts and layouts have been attempted, such as <a href=""> Common Building Block </a>but the industry remains largerly <a href=""> proprietary</a> and fragmented. There is no industry-wide standard <a href="">form factor</a> for laptops. Morever, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SSD, RAM, etc.) to reduce size and upgradeablity prospects.</p>
<strong>Ergonomics and health effects <a href="">[edit]</a></strong><br><br>
<strong>Wrists <a href="">[edit]</a></strong>
<p>Prolonged use of laptops can cause <a href=""> repetitive strain injury</a> because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices. <a href=""><sup>[61]</sup></a> Usage of seperated, externalaa <a href=""> ergonomic keyboards</a> and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time, they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB, <a href=""> Bluetooth </a>or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.</p>
<b>Neck and spine <a href="">[edit]</a></b>
<p>A laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a <a href="">computer stand.</a></p>
